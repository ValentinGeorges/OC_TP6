Project for OpenClassrooms / Creating an API using node.js, express.js and MongoDB Atlas.

If you want to run this project, all you have to do is to download this repo, go to the frontend folder, npm install -> ng serve, then to the backend folder, npm install -> npm start, and finally go to http://localhost:4200 so you can start browsing the website.

(You will need the .env file if you want the app to be connected with the database, I'll send it to you if you want, it's not included in the repo for secrurity purposes. Once you have, simply paste it in your root folder.)
